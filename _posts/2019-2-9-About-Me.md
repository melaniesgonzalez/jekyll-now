## About Me
My name is Melanie S. Gonzalez and I am a 4th-year doctoral student in developmental psychology at UT Austin. I have a passion for research aimed at improving adolescents' psychological experiences and educational outcomes. I also deeply enjoy programming and conducting analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data. 

Once I graduate, my goal is to begin a career as an education data analyst, where I can apply my research training and personal interests to the task of solving major issues in education. You can check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/curriculumvitae">CV</a> and [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-s-gonzalez/) to learn more about my training, skills, and experiences. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at [mnetter@utexas.edu](mailto:mnetter@utexas.edu)!
