# Features

## Customizable theme
The theme can be customized just by changing few variables in **_config.yml** file.
Since the theme is based on default Jekyll theme, it is very lightweight. No JavaScript except analytics is used!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
