## About Me
My name is Melanie S. Gonzalez and I am a 4th-year doctoral student in developmental psychology at UT Austin. I have a passion for research aimed at improving adolescents' psychological experiences and educational outcomes. I also deeply enjoy programming and conducting analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data. Once I graduate, my goal is to begin a career as an education data analyst, where I can apply my research training and personal interests to the task of solving major issues in education.   I created this website as a way to show off my programming and analytic skills in a single portfolio. Since I believe in responsible and reproducible science, I've provided all of the code for my analyses in Markdown files on my personal GitHub page. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email!
