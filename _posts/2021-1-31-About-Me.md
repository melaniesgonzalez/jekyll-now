## About Me
My name is Melanie S. Gonzalez and I am a 6th-year doctoral student in Developmental Psychology at UT Austin, where I am also completing a portfolio in Applied Statistical Modeling. I have a passion for using data to improve adolescents' educational outcomes and reduce social inequalities in education. I have advanced training in statistical inference and causal inference techniques. I also have expertise in the social-psychological factors that promote educational success during mid to late adolescence, including across the high school and college transitions.

I aspire to a career in education research and program evaluation, where I can apply my skills and expertise to the task of helping educational organizations make evidence-based decisions that change students' lives for the better. You can check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/curriculumvitae">resume</a> and [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-s-gonzalez/) to learn more about my training, skills, and experiences. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at [msgonzalez@utexas.edu](mailto:msgonzalez@utexas.edu)!
